MitCOM-utilities
======================================

Utility scripts for working with data from MitCOM publication.

A set of Jupyter notebooks that include demonstrations of all these scripts is launchable in active form right in your browser is at my [pdbepisa-binder repo](https://github.com/fomightez/mitcom-binder). Just go [there](https://github.com/fomightez/mitcom-binder) and click the `launch binder` badge to get started.

# The scripts

* extract_gene_list_from_screen_copied_MitCOM_data.py
* > MitCOM copied from screen and pasted into text file ---> list of the genes corresponding to the proteins with data in the list
Takes data in a file copy-pasted from [MitCOM](https://www.complexomics.org/datasets/mitcom) explorer portal and extracts the standard gene names to a new file. One gene name to each line. 
It will process any file in the same directory that ends in `.md` (setting at momemnt), and so save the input files with that extension and without spaces.
